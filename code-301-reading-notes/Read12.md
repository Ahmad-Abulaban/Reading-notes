# Mongo and Mongoose

## Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:-

| SQL | NoSQL |
| --- | ----------- |
| Relational Databases | non-relational or distributed database. |
| table based | document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores. |
| predefined schema | dynamic schema for unstructured data. |
| vertically scalable | horizontally scalable |
|  structured query language | Unstructured Query Language |
| not best fit for hierarchical data storage | fits better for the hierarchical data storage |

***

## What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

**conventional SQL based databases are the best fit.**

***

## Give a real world example?

* MySQL.
* MS-SQL.
* Oracle.
* Sqlite.
* Postgres.

***

## What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

* NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data.
* NoSQL database are highly preferred for large data set (i.e for big data).

***

## Give a real world example:-

* MongoDB.
* CouchDB.
* Redis.
* BigTable.
* RavenDb.
* Hbase.
* Neo4j.

## Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

**`NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage` as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data.**

***

## Which type of database is best for scalability?

**SQL databases are vertically scalable. You can manage increasing load by increasing the CPU, RAM, SSD, etc, on a single server. On the other hand, NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. You can just add few more servers easily in your NoSQL database infrastructure to handle the large traffic.**

***

## What does SQL stand for?

**SQL stands for `Structured Query Language.`**

***

## What is a realational database?

**`A relational database` is a digital database based on the relational model of data. A system used to maintain relational databases is a relational database management system. Many relational database systems have an option of using the SQL for querying and maintaining the database.**

***

## What type of structure does a relational database work with?

**The relational model means that the logical data structures—the data tables, views, and indexes—are separate from the physical storage structures. This separation means that database administrators can manage physical data storage without affecting access to that data as a logical structure.**

***

## What is a ‘schema’?

**A schema, or scheme, is an abstract concept proposed by J. Piaget to refer to our, well, abstract concepts. Schemas (or schemata) are units of understanding that can be hierarchically categorized as well as webbed into complex relationships with one another. For example, think of a house.**

***

## What is a NoSQL database?

**A NoSQL database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases.**

***

## How does it work?

**NoSQL is an approach to databases that represents a shift away from traditional relational database management systems (RDBMS). Relational databases rely on tables, columns, rows, or schemas to organize and retrieve data. In contrast, NoSQL databases do not rely on these structures and use more flexible data models.**

***

## What is inside of a Mongo database?

**Mongodb is one of the most popular document based `NoSQL database` as it stores data in JSON like documents. It is non-relational database with dynamic schema.**

***

## Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.

**While MongoDB is more flexible and ensures high and diverse data availability, a SQL Database operates with the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) properties and ensures greater reliability of transactions.**

***

## What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

**`NoSQL databases` don't have the reliability functions which Relational Databases have (basically don't support ACID).**
