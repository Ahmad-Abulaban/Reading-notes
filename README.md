# Summary

- **Growth mindset:** the hand you're dealt is only the beginning of your journey. This growth mentality is founded on the idea that you can improve your basic traits by putting out effort. Changing our perspectives may have a significant influence. The growth mentality fosters a strong desire to learn.
- **A growth mindset** means that you believe your intelligence and talents can be developed over time. A fixed mindset means that you believe intelligence is fixed—so if you’re not good at something, you might believe you’ll never be good at it.
