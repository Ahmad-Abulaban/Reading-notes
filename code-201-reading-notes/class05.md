# Images

## Adding Images

`<img>` 

**To add an image into the page you need to use an `<img>` element. This is an empty element (which means there is no closing tag). It must carry the following two attributes:**


- src

**This tells the browser where it can find the image file. This will usually be a relative URL pointing to an image on your own site.**

- alt

**This provides a text description of the image which describes the image if you cannot see it.**

- title

**You can also use the title attribute with the <img> element to provide additional information about the image. Most browsers will display the content of this attribute in a tootip when the user hovers over the image.**


`<img src="url" alt="Name" title="titleName" />`

***

## Height & Width of Images

- height

**This specifies the height of the image in pixels.**

- width

**This specifies the width of the image in pixels.**

**ŸèExample:**

`<img src="Url" alt="Name" width="600" height="450" />`

# Summary

* The <img> element is used to add images to a web page.
* You must always specify a src attribute to indicate the source of an image and an alt attribute to describe the content of an image.
* You should save images at the size you will be using them on the web page and in the appropriate format.
* Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs.
