* Adding background images

**The background-image property allows you to place an image behind any HTML element. This could be the entire page or just part of the page. By default, a background image will repeat to fill the entire box.**

**The path to the image follows the letters url, and it is put inside parentheses and quotes.**

Summary

* Flash allows you to add animations, video and audio to the web.
* Flash is not supported on iPhone or iPad. 
* HTML5 introduces new `<video>` and `<audio>` elements for adding video and audio to web pages, but these are only supported in the latest browsers.
* Browsers that support the HTML5 elements do not all support the same video and audio formats, so you need to supply your files in different formats to ensure that everyone can see/hear them.
