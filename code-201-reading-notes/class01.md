# Process & Design

## wireframe

**A wireframe is a low fidelity representation of a web page that shows the basic elements of the page. They are not interactive, and do not show much detail, but create a simple design that guides the project. Once it starts becoming interactive, it becomes a prototype.**

* Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.

* Wireframes allow you to organize the information that will need to go on each page.

* Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.

* You can differentiate between pieces of information using size, color, and style.



# What is JavaScript?

**JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows you to make web pages interactive. Where HTML and CSS are languages that give structure and style to web pages, JavaScript gives web pages interactive elements that engage a user.**

## What is JavaScript used for?

1. Adding interactive behavior to web pages.
2. Creating web and mobile apps.
3. Building web servers and developing server applications.
4. Game development.

## Summary:

1. A script is made up of a series of statements. Each statement is like a step in a recipe.
2. Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example, you might specify that a value must be remembered before creating a calculation using that value.
3. Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in the script. 

# FUNCTIONS, METHODS & OBJECTS

**A function in JavaScript is a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output.**

2. Functions can take parameters (informatiorJ required to do their job) and may return a value.

3. An object is a series of variables and functions that represent something from the world around you.
