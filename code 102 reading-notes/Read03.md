# What is wireframing?

### Wireframing is a technique for designing a website's structure. A wireframe is a diagram that shows how information and functionality on a website should be laid up, taking into consideration user demands and journeys. Early in the development process, wireframes are used to create the fundamental framework of a page before visual design and content are added.

## In UI design, wireframing is critical

* A wireframe is a web page layout that shows what interface components will be present on important pages. It's an important step in the interface design process.

* A wireframe's purpose is to offer a visual representation of a page early in a project so that stakeholders and project team members may approve it before the creative process begins. Wireframes may also be used to build the global and secondary navigation, ensuring that the site's vocabulary and structure fit user expectations.
