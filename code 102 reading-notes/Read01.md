## What is Markdown?

- **Everything can be written in Markdown. Websites, papers, notes, books, presentations, email messages, and technical documentation are all created with it. Markdown is a portable text editor. Virtually any program may open files containing Markdown-formatted text.**
- **Markdown is a web-based text formatting system. You have complete control over how the text appears; bolding or italicizing phrases, inserting photos, and making lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Markdown is mostly simply plain text with a few non-alphabetic characters like # or * tossed in for good measure.**
