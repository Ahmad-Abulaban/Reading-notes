# What is CSS?

**CSS is a language for specifying how Web pages are presented, including colors, layout, and fonts. It enables the presentation to be adjusted for different types of devices, such as huge displays, tiny screens, or printers. CSS may be used with any XML-based markup language and is not dependant on HTML. The separation of HTML and CSS makes it easier to manage websites, exchange style sheets across pages, and customize pages for diverse situations. The separation of structure (or: content) from appearance is referred to as this.**

# CSS syntax

**A selector and a declaration block make up a CSS rule set: The selector identifies the HTML element that needs to be styled. One or more declarations are separated by semicolons in the declaration block. A colon separates the name of the CSS property and its value in each declaration.**

# CSS Modules

**A CSS Module is a CSS file that, by default, defines localized class and animation names. CSS modules allow you to import a.css file into a JavaScript Object and assign CSS definitions to properties. It also allows you to expand and modularize style declarations by using the compose feature.**
